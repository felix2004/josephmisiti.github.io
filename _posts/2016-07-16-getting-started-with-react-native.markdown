The following is a list of notes I made while building an iphone/andriod app using react native.
To get started, install the latest version of the operating system globally:

```
sudo npm install -g react-native@latest
```

If you just updated to OSX 10.11.5, you may need to change the permissions on your `/user/local` directory:

```
sudo chown $(USER):admin /usr/local
```
