I just finished [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898) By Eric Ries. Overall, the book was pretty good. I am not sure I buy into everything he says - the book was written a while ago (2008), so I believe that some of the concepts in the book dont really apply to mobile development cycles like iPhone, but overall, there were some good points in the book:

The basic premise of the book is to build a minimum viable product, launch it, and then look at customer feedback to decide what to add and subtract, or if it might be time to pivot. One interesting concept he developed was Innovation Accounting, which Ries defines as

> To improve entrepreneurial outcomes, and to hold entrepreneurs accountable, we need to focus on the boring stuff: how to measure progress, how to setup milestones, how to prioritize work. This requires a new kind of accounting, specific to startups.


Basically, Innovation Accounting effectively helps startups to define, measure, and communicate progress. He goes into great deal about vanity metrics and advocates the use of [cohort analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_analysis).
