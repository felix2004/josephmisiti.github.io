Some of my favorite quotes/passages from the book.

"We do not spontaneously learn that we dont learn waht we dnt learn."

"Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. A library should contain as much of what you do no know as your financial means
mortgage rates, and currently tight real-estate market allow you to put in there."
