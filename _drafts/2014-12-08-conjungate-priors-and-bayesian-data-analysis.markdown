If you are just getting started in Bayesian data analysis, conjugate priors can be your best friend, and they will simplify the analysis and make calculate the posterior distribution much easier. Since most introductery problems start with coin flipping problems - you end up studying the Bernoulli distribution. The conjugate prior to the Bernoulli distribution is know as the Beta distribution (not to be confused with the Beta function).
