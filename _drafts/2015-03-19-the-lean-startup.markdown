I just finished [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898) By Eric Ries. Overall, the book was pretty good. I am not sure I buy into everything he says - the book was written a while ago (2008), so I believe that some of the concepts in the book dont really apply to mobile development cycles like iPhone, but overall, there were some good points in the book:

### Minimum Viable Product

This is a software product which is used to test the fundemental hypothesis of the business. If you dont know if your idea is going to be a success (and lets face it, you never really do) - what do you **need** to build to determine if if your idea is great or if you are going to need to pivot. 

### Innovation Accounting

### Build / Measure / Learn

### Vanity Metrics + Cohort Analysis
